# Changelog

What changed for every user, newest first.

## Unreleased

- Fresh install, reproducible (backlog item 1): Python packages install from one hashed lock for
  every OS (`plugins/ai-editor/requirements/requirements.lock`, `uv pip compile --universal`,
  Python 3.10+); the renderer installs with `npm ci` from its package-lock.json; the whisper
  (tiny, small), face and matting models are pinned by URL and sha256 in `lib/ai_editor/models.py`
  and checked on download. `setup.py bootstrap` installs everything and is safe to re-run (a second
  run downloads and changes nothing); `setup.py repair` puts the exact pinned set back. What got
  installed is recorded in `~/.ai-video-editor/env.json`; doctor prints FIX on drift from it and
  checks minimum Python 3.10, ffmpeg 4.4 and Node 20 with the exact fix command. CI installs from
  zero with the bootstrap on Mac, Windows (through `py`) and Linux, re-runs it, drifts a package and
  repairs it (tests/fresh_install.py), then runs smoke. setup.py demo covers the drift check
- Fixed: the transcribers (cut and creator-teardown) and clips ignored AI_EDITOR_HOME, so an
  install there downloaded the 500 MB model again into ~/.ai-video-editor
- Fixed: on Linux and Windows rapidocr pulled in opencv-python next to opencv-python-headless, two
  packages writing the same cv2 folder; the lock leaves opencv-python out
- Fixed: the face model came from opencv_zoo's moving main branch; whisper re-resolved the Hub's
  latest revision on every transcript; the renderer re-installed only when package.json changed,
  never when the lock did
- improve skill: collects suggestions, taste regressions, preview corrections and feedback issues, grouped, for fixes with a test each; docs/feedback-matrix.md maps every rule to its check and test
- taste: after a correction, ask this video / my style / would help everyone; everyone writes a scrubbed suggestion and can open a GitHub issue (taste.py suggest, issue)
- journey.py demo: a cursor cut by the frame edge fails and is hidden; empty ground counts as no product
- golden.py: the default look must carry no banned AI tell, planned (demo) and rendered (full run)
- check.py: a number on a built card that the speaker never says is a FAIL (check.py demo)
- record.mjs: create is on the deny list; tests/test_record.mjs proves the deny list and the blur (incl. the logged-in name) on a synthetic page
- product.py: story order checked (hook first, end last, result after action, payoff before end; make-before-discover warns); default length in gates.target_length (gates.py demo)
- product.py: music needs --rights, --file records a file's licence, plan refuses an own track with no recorded rights (gates.py demo)
- product.py: plan refuses without brief.json; render refuses a plan not stamped by product.py approve, or changed since (gates.py demo)
- check_plugins: every own SKILL.md must say AskUserQuestion; the key links in setup and the asking evals cannot be dropped
